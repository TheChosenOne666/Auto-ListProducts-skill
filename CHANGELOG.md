# Changelog

## 0.1.0 — 2026-11-01

First public version.

- Discovery-first workflow: preflight → probe → profile → pilot → queue → fill → audit.
- `scripts/check_profile.py` refuses a half-probed profile before any product is touched.
- `scripts/crop_square.py` crops square images and guards two real failures: blank crops (the source
  screenshot's product photo never rendered) and carousel dots leaking into the bottom edge.
- `scripts/check_images.py` audits local files or hosted URLs for blank uploads.
- `scripts/make_queue.py` builds a resumable queue; points, display counters, a coupon floor and the case
  SKU row are opt-in, so no business rule is baked in.
- `scripts/fill_xlsx.py` appends registration rows while keeping price columns numeric and formulas alive.
- References: probe checklist, browser playbook, failure catalogue.
- Evals: six briefs covering the preflight, probe, blank crop, dot artifact, session expiry, bundle pricing.
